This folder contains various benchmark cases which were produced with the ACRE framework
These are here as benchmark cases to ensure you are getting the same output when you run the code yourself.

The two cases that have been shown are with the M2.25 Nozzle (Leeds) and M4.0 Nozzle (Leeds)

The first case with the M2.25 Nozzle has the following parameters set in the 'Parametric_Study.m' file:

CPU_Cores = 40
Ansys_Version = 2
Tin = 300
Tout = 300
Pin = [5222.72]
Pout = [170.65]
Bath Gas = 2
Reactor_Length = 774
Reactor_Radius = 120
Reservoir_Radius = 5
Reservoir_Length = 10
Reservoir_Inlet_Diameter = 2.94
Outlet_Diameter = 150
Outlet_Position = 550

Note these can be doubled checked by going into the M2.25_Benchmark_Case and opening variable_output.txt.
