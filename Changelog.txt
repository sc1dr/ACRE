BRIEF CHANGELOG FOR THE ACRE FRAMEWORK

V1.0 Deployed In October 2023/

V1.1 - 24/10/2023
Nozzle_Characterisation_CFD.m script was altered to account for the fact the number of nozzle points can change in the XY file.
It was originally kept the same for all cases with respect to the benchmark although was causing issues with generating the mesh.
The mesh would not be created if the number of nozzle points were >116 or <116, Therefore this was changed by adding:

Which uses MATLAB to calculate the number of XY points, and then puts it in the Macro file.
This was originally accounted for in one part of the code but not this part.
% Change points to account for number of points in XY file
ScriptChanger(ICEM_Script_File,106, ['ic_hex_split_grid 41 19 pnt', num2str(Nozzle_Profile_Points - 1), ' m PNTS FLUID RESERVOIR_WALL INLET NOZZLE_WALL LEFT_REACTOR_WALL TOP_REACTOR_WALL OUTLET RIGHT_REACTOR_WALL AXIS VORFN'])
ScriptChanger(ICEM_Script_File,109, ['ic_hex_split_grid 11 13 pnt', num2str(Nozzle_Profile_Points - 1), ' m PNTS FLUID RESERVOIR_WALL INLET NOZZLE_WALL LEFT_REACTOR_WALL TOP_REACTOR_WALL OUTLET RIGHT_REACTOR_WALL AXIS VORFN'])
ScriptChanger(ICEM_Script_File,116, ['ic_hex_move_node 61 pnt', num2str(Nozzle_Profile_Points - 1)])

V1.2 - 30/10/2023
Updated y+ mesh adaption as it was not working correctly before. Now its working and adapts the mesh to ensure y+ < 1 everywhere for every case.

V1.3 06/11/2023
Updated fluent script to output 2D contour for density, temperature, mach and pressure. I also included a script that makes a 2D
contour plot the data and outputs it into the Contour_Data folder. Added 2D temeprature output in the form of a .txt file

V2.0 10/11/2023 - Changed Nozzle_Characterisation_CFD into a function to allow users to be able to parametrically change
the pressure and recieve multiple outputs. Converted the nozzle_profile_formatter to a function and streamliend its usage in
the Parametric_Study.m file.

V3.0 17/11/2023 - Added the ability to output 2D contour data for temperature. pressure, density and temperature. Now allows
the user to state how far they want the 2D data away from the flow axis. Added a detailed user guide to help.

V4.0 03/05/2024 - Added the ability to change the solver type, mesh density, pseudo timescale factor and other options in the main Parametric_Study.m file.
Also added files containing benchmark test. mesh dependence studies and a comparison between the pressure and density based solver. An additional Folder has been
added which is named "Isentropic_Nozzle_Calculator" this can be used to estimate the Mach number, temperature and pressure ratio for any nozzle input.
